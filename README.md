> Psalm 119 a

א Aleph

1Blessed are those whose ways are blameless,

who walk according to the law of the Lord.

2Blessed are those who keep his statutes

and seek him with all their heart—

3they do no wrong

but follow his ways.

4You have laid down precepts

that are to be fully obeyed.

5Oh, that my ways were steadfast

in obeying your decrees!

6Then I would not be put to shame

when I consider all your commands.

7I will praise you with an upright heart

as I learn your righteous laws.

8I will obey your decrees;

do not utterly forsake me.

ב Beth

9How can a young person stay on the path of purity?

By living according to your word.

10I seek you with all my heart;

do not let me stray from your commands.

11I have hidden your word in my heart

that I might not sin against you.

12Praise be to you, Lord;

teach me your decrees.

13With my lips I recount

all the laws that come from your mouth.

14I rejoice in following your statutes

as one rejoices in great riches.

15I meditate on your precepts

and consider your ways.

16I delight in your decrees;

I will not neglect your word.

## Lakeside Sermon of the Sower's Parable
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+4%3A1-20&version=NIV

### Mark 4:1-20
> The Parable of the Sower
4 Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water’s edge. 2 He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said: 3 “Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed. 4 As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. 5 Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. 6 But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. 7 Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain. 8 Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, some multiplying thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times.”

9 Then Jesus said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”

10 When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables. 11 He told them, “The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables 12 so that,

“‘they may be ever seeing but never perceiving,
    and ever hearing but never understanding;
otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!’[a]”
13 Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable? 14 The farmer sows the word. 15 Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. 16 Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy. 17 But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. 18 Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word; 19 but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful. 20 Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop—some thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times what was sown.”

Hebrews 13:5 New International Version (NIV)

5 Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said,

“Never will I leave you;
    never will I forsake you.”
    
    6 So we say with confidence,

“The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.
    What can mere mortals do to me?”

2 Corinthians 8:13-15
> 2 Corinthians 8:13-15 New International Version (NIV)

13 Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality. 14 At the present time your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. The goal is equality, 15 as it is written: “The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little.”

Ephesians 3:14-21 New Living Translation (NLT)

> Paul’s Prayer for Spiritual Growth
>14 When I think of all this, I fall to my knees and pray to the Father,[a] 15 the Creator of everything in heaven and on >earth.[b] 16 I pray that from his glorious, unlimited resources he will empower you with inner strength through his Spirit. >17 Then Christ will make his home in your hearts as you trust in him. Your roots will grow down into God’s love and keep you >strong. 18 And may you have the power to understand, as all God’s people should, how wide, how long, how high, and how deep >his love is.

# Psalm 139:13-18
13 For you created my inmost being;
    you knit me together in my mother’s womb.
14 I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made;
    your works are wonderful,
    I know that full well.
15 My frame was not hidden from you
    when I was made in the secret place,
    when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.
16 Your eyes saw my unformed body;
    all the days ordained for me were written in your book
    before one of them came to be.
17 How precious to me are your thoughts,[a] God!
    How vast is the sum of them!
18 Were I to count them,
    they would outnumber the grains of sand—
    when I awake, I am still with you.

# Luke 7:11-17
. A young man had died, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her. 13 And when the Lord saw her, His heart was filled with pity for her, and He said to her, “Do not weep”. 14 Then He walked over and touched the coffin, while the pallbearers stood still. Jesus said to the dead man, “Young man, I say to thee, arise!” And he who was dead, sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.

16 Then they all were filled with awe and praised God. And they said, “A great prophet has risen among us”, and “God has visited His people”.

17 This news about Jesus went out through all the country and the surrounding territory.


# 2nd Samuel 12:23 (ESV)
23 But now he is dead. Why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.”

https://www.crossway.org/articles/why-does-the-bible-say-so-much-about-widows/


The beauty of John 19:26–27 is reflected in the care Jesus had for His mother, as well as the care John provided for her. Scripture clearly teaches the importance of caring for widows and the elderly, something Jesus personally applied during His final hours of His earthly ministry. James, the half-brother of Jesus, would later call such care for widows “pure religion.” “Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world” (James 1:27).

3. Woman, behold, thy son! Son, behold, thy mother!

Crucifixion depicted as Stabat Mater with the Virgin Mary, Porto Alegre, Brasil, 19th century.
John 19:26-27

When Jesus, therefore, saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he said to his mother, "Woman, behold, thy son!" After that, he said to the disciple, "Son, behold, thy mother!" And from that hour, that disciple took her unto his own home.
